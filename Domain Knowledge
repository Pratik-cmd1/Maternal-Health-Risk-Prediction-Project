Business Problem:

Healthcare systems struggle to identify and prioritize high-risk pregnancies, leading to preventable complications and higher maternal mortality rates. By building a reliable prediction model, we can help doctors identify risks early, provide timely care, and improve outcomes for mothers and babies. This will save lives and make healthcare more efficient.

Problem Statement:

Maternal health risks during pregnancy can lead to severe complications or even death if not identified early. Current methods often fail to predict these risks accurately, especially in resource-limited settings. The goal is to use machine learning to predict maternal health risk levels (Low, Medium, High) based on factors like Age, SystolicBP, DiastolicBP, BS,BodyTemp,HeartRate,RiskLevel,Hemoglobin,BMI,Parity,SmokingStatus,PhysicalActivityLevel



Normal Criteria for Each Parameter :

1] Age:

Risk increases with age, especially after 55 for women. Young individuals (e.g., <40 years) are typically at lower risk unless other factors are abnormal.

2] Systolic Blood Pressure (SystolicBP):

Normal: 90–120 mmHg Elevated: 121–129 mmHg High (Hypertension Stage 1): 130–139 mmHg High (Hypertension Stage 2): ≥140 mmHg

3] Diastolic Blood Pressure (DiastolicBP):

Normal: 60–80 mmHg Elevated: 81–89 mmHg High: ≥90 mmHg

4] Blood Sugar (BS) (Fasting Glucose Levels):

Normal: 70–99 mg/dL Pre-diabetes: 100–125 mg/dL Diabetes: ≥126 mg/dL

5] Body Temperature (BodyTemp):

Normal: 97°F–99°F (36.1°C–37.2°C) Fever (>100.4°F or 38°C) could indicate infection or inflammation.

6] Heart Rate:

Normal Resting Heart Rate: 60–100 beats per minute (bpm) Lower (<60 bpm) in athletes or due to certain medications. Higher (>100 bpm) indicates tachycardia, which may signal risk.

7] Hemoglobin:

Normal Levels: Men: 13.8–17.2 g/dL Women: 12.1–15.1 g/dL Children: 11.1–16.1 g/dL Low hemoglobin indicates anemia; high levels could suggest other health issues.

8] Body Mass Index (BMI):

Underweight: <18.5 Normal Weight: 18.5–24.9 Overweight: 25–29.9 Obese: ≥30

9] Parity (Number of Pregnancies):

Increased parity may influence long-term health, particularly in women, affecting BMI, diabetes risk, etc.

10] Smoking Status:

Non-Smoker: Lower risk. Smoker: Higher risk of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases.

11] Physical Activity Level:

Active: Regular exercise; lower risk. Sedentary: Lack of physical activity; higher risk.

General Risk Prediction Guidelines

1] Low Risk:

All parameters fall within the normal range. Physically active, non-smoker, normal BMI, and no other significant health conditions.

2] Moderate Risk:

One or two parameters slightly deviate from normal (e.g., pre-diabetes, slightly elevated BP). Lifestyle factors such as occasional smoking or irregular physical activity.

3] High Risk:

Multiple parameters significantly deviate from normal (e.g., high BP, diabetes, obesity, smoking). Presence of chronic conditions or a history of cardiovascular diseases. Risk Level Decision Tree

A simple framework for risk prediction:

Check Critical Values:

If SystolicBP ≥140, DiastolicBP ≥90, or BS ≥126 → High Risk. If HeartRate >100 bpm or BMI ≥30 → Consider Moderate/High Risk. Lifestyle Factors:

Smoking or sedentary behavior → Upgrade risk level by one category. Combine Factors:

Multiple moderate deviations (e.g., pre-diabetes + elevated BP) → High Risk.
