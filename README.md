Introduction

Maternal health is a crucial aspect of healthcare that significantly impacts both mother and child. With advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning, predicting maternal health risks has become more efficient, leading to better preventive measures and improved healthcare outcomes. The Maternal Health Risk Prediction Project leverages data science to assess the risk levels of expectant mothers based on key health parameters.

Project Overview

This project is designed to predict maternal health risks using machine learning techniques. It aims to provide healthcare professionals and pregnant women with an early warning system, helping them take necessary precautions to avoid complications. The app, developed using Streamlit, offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface for risk assessment.

Problem Statement

Maternal health complications can lead to severe outcomes, including preterm birth, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, and even maternal mortality. Traditional diagnostic methods may not always detect risks early, leading to delayed interventions. This project aims to bridge this gap by using machine learning models trained on maternal health data to predict risk levels accurately.

Dataset and Features

The dataset used in this project comprises essential maternal health indicators, including:

Age – The age of the pregnant woman, as older mothers may face higher risks.

Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) – A higher SBP may indicate hypertension-related complications.

Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP) – Essential in monitoring cardiovascular health.

Blood Sugar Level – Elevated sugar levels may indicate gestational diabetes.

Body Temperature – Fever or abnormal body temperature could signify infections.

Heart Rate – An irregular heart rate may suggest cardiovascular issues.

These features help classify maternal health risk into three categories:

Low Risk

Medium Risk

High Risk

Methodology

Data Preprocessing

Handling Missing Values – Imputation techniques were used for missing data.

Feature Scaling – Standardization was applied to normalize data values.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Statistical insights were drawn to understand data distribution and correlations.

Machine Learning Models Used

Several machine learning models were tested to determine the best-performing one:

Logistic Regression – A simple yet effective classification model.

Decision Tree Classifier – Helps in decision-making by splitting data based on features.

Random Forest Classifier – An ensemble approach that improves accuracy.

Support Vector Machine (SVM) – Effective for classification with hyperplane separation.

XGBoost – A powerful boosting technique improving model performance.

The best model was selected based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Model Evaluation and Performance

The performance of the models was evaluated using metrics such as:

Accuracy – Overall correctness of predictions.

Precision – Correct positive predictions compared to total positive predictions.

Recall – Ability to identify all actual positive cases.

F1-Score – Harmonic mean of precision and recall for balanced performance.

After hyperparameter tuning, the Random Forest Classifier delivered the highest accuracy, making them the preferred models for deployment.

Deployment with Streamlit

The application was developed using Streamlit, allowing users to input their health parameters and receive a risk assessment. Key features of the app include:

User-Friendly Interface – Simple input fields for seamless interaction.

Real-Time Predictions – Users get instant results based on their data.

Interpretability – Clear visualization of risk levels for better understanding.

Real-World Applications

The Maternal Health Risk Prediction App can be used in multiple scenarios:

Hospitals and Clinics – Assists doctors in making data-driven decisions.

Rural Healthcare Programs – Helps in remote areas where expert doctors may not be available.

Government Healthcare Initiatives – Supports maternal health programs by providing risk insights.

Self-Assessment for Expectant Mothers – Educates mothers about potential risks and preventive measures.

Challenges and Limitations

Data Availability – Access to more diverse datasets can improve model generalizability.

Bias in Data – Ensuring that predictions are unbiased across different demographics.

Integration with Healthcare Systems – Seamless integration with hospital databases can enhance usability.

Future Enhancements

To improve the project further, the following enhancements are planned:

Incorporating More Features – Adding parameters like BMI, medical history, and lifestyle habits.

Deep Learning Models – Exploring neural networks for better predictive power.

Mobile App Development – Extending the platform to a mobile application for better accessibility.

Multilingual Support – Making the app available in multiple languages to reach a wider audience.

Ethical Considerations

Privacy Protection – Ensuring data security and compliance with healthcare regulations.

Bias Mitigation – Regular audits to ensure fair predictions.

Transparency in Predictions – Providing explanations for risk assessments.

Conclusion

The Maternal Health Risk Prediction Project is a significant step towards improving maternal healthcare using artificial intelligence. By enabling early risk detection, it empowers healthcare professionals and expectant mothers to take proactive measures, ultimately reducing maternal mortality and complications. As the project evolves, continuous improvements will enhance its accuracy, accessibility, and real-world impact.
